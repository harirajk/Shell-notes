<h1>Shell</h1>

**A Shell  is an user interface for access to Services offered by the Operating System. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface or graphical user interface, depending on a computer's role and particular operation.**

Atleast that is how wikipedia defines Shell.So you are probably thinking why use a command-line interface when, most operating systems provide GUIs.It results in faster performance and uses a lot less of the system's resources.And what's more.It gives you more of the programmer feel.

<h2>Bash</h2>
Bash(Bourne Again SHell) is the shell used by the GNU operating system.It has grown out to be one of the most popular command language interpreter after DOS.
